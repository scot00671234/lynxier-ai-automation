# Lynxier - AI Workflow Builder

## Overview

Lynxier is a modern full-stack web application that allows users to create and execute AI-powered automation workflows through a visual drag-and-drop interface. The system features a node-based workflow builder similar to n8n, where users can visually connect workflow steps using ReactFlow components to create custom automation pipelines including file uploads, text inputs, AI processing, email sending, and conditional logic.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with clear separation between frontend and backend concerns:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Custom component library built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming and shadcn/ui component system

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for database operations
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **API Pattern**: RESTful API design with JSON responses

### Development Setup
- **Monorepo Structure**: Single repository with separate client, server, and shared directories
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend bundling
- **Development**: Hot reload for both frontend and backend during development

## Key Components

### Workflow Management
- **Workflow Creation**: Visual node-based workflow builder using ReactFlow with drag-and-drop interface
- **Visual Editor**: Full-screen canvas with node palette, connection system, and minimap navigation
- **Step Types**: Support for file uploads, text inputs, AI processing, email sending, and conditional logic represented as connected nodes
- **Execution Engine**: Asynchronous workflow execution with progress tracking
- **Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration

### AI Integration
- **Multiple Providers**: OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4, Google AI Gemini 2.5 models
- **Unified Interface**: AIProviderManager for seamless switching between providers
- **Capabilities**: Text processing (summarization, rewriting, analysis, extraction, generation) and image analysis
- **Configuration**: Provider selection, model customization, temperature control, and custom instructions

### File Processing
- **Upload Support**: PDF and DOCX file uploads with 5MB size limit
- **Text Extraction**: Basic text extraction from uploaded documents
- **Storage**: Memory-based file processing with metadata tracking

### Email Services
- **Provider**: Nodemailer with SMTP configuration
- **Templates**: Dynamic email template system with variable substitution
- **Development**: Ethereal Email for testing during development

## Data Flow

### Workflow Creation Flow
1. User creates workflow through the web interface
2. Frontend sends workflow data to REST API
3. Backend validates and stores workflow configuration
4. Steps are individually configured and linked to workflow
5. Workflow status can be set to draft, active, or inactive

### Workflow Execution Flow
1. User initiates workflow execution
2. System creates execution record with "running" status
3. Steps are processed sequentially based on configuration
4. AI processing steps call OpenAI API with configured prompts
5. File upload steps process and extract text from documents
6. Email steps send notifications using configured templates
7. Progress is tracked and stored in execution results
8. Final status is updated to "completed", "failed", or "stopped"

### Data Persistence
- Workflows and steps are stored with UUID primary keys
- Execution results are stored as JSONB for flexibility
- Database schema uses PostgreSQL-specific features through Drizzle ORM

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **AI Service**: OpenAI API for text processing
- **Email Service**: SMTP provider for email sending
- **File Processing**: In-memory processing with planned external service integration
- **Visual Workflow**: ReactFlow for node-based workflow editor with drag-and-drop functionality

### Development Dependencies
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives for accessible components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for API state management

### Infrastructure Dependencies
- **Build Tools**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript across the entire stack
- **Database Tools**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with hot reload
- **Database**: Development database connection via environment variables
- **API Integration**: Local Express server with middleware for development

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Static build output to `dist/public` directory
- **Backend**: Bundled Node.js application using esbuild
- **Environment**: Production configuration through environment variables
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL connection with connection pooling

### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Database URLs, API keys, and service configurations
- **Build Scripts**: Separate build processes for client and server
- **Static Serving**: Express serves built frontend in production mode
